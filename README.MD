# Uppercaser - the most unnecessary program in the world
For real, you are never gonna use this
## What does this do?
It translates lowercase to UPPERCASE
## When it is so useless, why are you even developing it?
This was a very easy test of Googles Blockly Programming interface. I just wanted to try it out, i dont think its going to be the future of programming, but its a good start for childs that want to start developing easy programs. Its definetly worth checking out!
## Blockly?
https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/code/index.html?lang=en
https://github.com/google/blockly
## Where is the code?
Please select a branch and then a programming language, i recommend python, its the most efficient one.
## Did you edit the files after creating them with Blockly?
No. The files in this repository is 100% the raw files from Blockly. You can recreate the files easily. Screenshot below (Blockly is in Development, so the final result CAN change)
## Is there a lowercaser?
No, because i dont want to flood my Github with thousands of useless Tools...
